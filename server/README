iGoat Server
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT

This file contains a very simple web server used by iGoat in some of
its exercises. It is a special purpose web server for very specific
purposes, not anything for general purpose use. It takes a specially
constructed input from iGoat, and responds back with information
needed by iGoat.

REQUIREMENTS

Most of what you'll need to run the server already comes with the default OS X
install (Ruby, etc.), but there are a few external gem requirements, which you
can install with the following command:

sudo gem install sinatra json

RUNNING

Simply invoke the igoat-server.rb script from the Terminal...

./igoat-server.rb

Ctrl-C to quit.

FURTHER DETAILS

See the comments in the script itself for ports, endpoints, etc.
